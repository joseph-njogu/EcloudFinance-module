# EcloudFinance-module
Education-cloud finance module is a software as a service(SaaS) that runs on cloud server online. In most cases, web browsers are used to access it over the network such as the internet. Most education institutions have been facing a challenge in managing and accounting for the funds and resources in Kenya. Education-cloud finance module will allow these institutions to manage and account for the funds and resources. This software will be deployed on the cloud servers to ease its access to any subscribed institution. Institutions will be able to enroll themselves in the service offered by this software. It will not be taking users(institutions) storage as it will not be a requirement to install the software in their local machines but rather it will be storing data in the cloud servers. The service will be accessed using the browsers over the internet.  Education-cloud finance module will be developed using django the python framework.

4.3 System Testing and Evaluation
This section will briefly describe how its planned to test the effectiveness and usability of the fully
developed software by the user and to also ascertain that the problem underlying is being solved by this project.
4.3.1 Test 1: Views
This involves testing the user interface. All the visible components are tested to ensure that they are responsive to the user interactions.  Also this tests that all the links and paths given point to the correct components. Testing the home page that it is using the rigt templates and points to the right static folders.
4.3.2 Test 2: Models
This involves testing the database. The purpose for the database is to store user information. Dummy data is fed into the database to ensure that data is being store, or through the creation of model mommy for testing purposes. Also the database is tested if it can provide the user with stored information.
4.3.3 Test 3: Forms
Forms plays a major role in any given system that involves registration of new users and retrieving user data from any storage sites like databases. Major things t be tested in this project are:
POSTING- the forms will be tested if they can post data into the database.
GETTING- the get method will be tested. That is verify if data can be retrieved from the database.
PUT- this is verify if the user information can be  fully updated upon deletion or creation
PATCH – verifying if the additional update done can update user information.

4.3.4 Test 4: financial management
The system will be tested against the objectives to see that the main objective is achieved.
